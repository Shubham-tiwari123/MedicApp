## MedicApp
_MedicApp is a platform for hospitals that help them to store their patient 
record safely using blockchain. These records can be accessed by those 
hospitals which are connected through the platform using the patient-id._

_It helps the hospital to get the patient medical history in very less time, which is 
useful during an emergency. It reduces the patient burden for maintaining the document of 
his/her medical record._ 

####Why Blockchain?
1. Blockchain only allows insertion of a new record. Hence no medical block can 
   be deleted once it gets stored in the chain.
2. It uses the hashing technique, which is used to verify if a record is 
   tempered or not.
3. It uses an encryption technique so that a valid person can only view the data. 
   This provides security to the data stored in blocks.
   
####Tech Stack
JAVA, Servlet, JSP, MongoDB, RestAPI, JSON, Maven, Socket

#### Implementation
 1. Used JAVA Socket to exchange the keys between Medic Server and Hospital(Client).
    
#### Future Expansion    

1. Develop a mobile application for patients so that they then also view their
   medical records.
2. Connect insurance companies to this platform. This will help patients to file 
   for their refunds easily.
